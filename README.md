### NOTE
I attempted the bonus portion of the challenge to add a gauge chart.  I was unable to find examples in the documentation on how to add labels inside of the sections or add an arrow indicator.  I found other people on the internet that created a pie chart to do something similar, but since the instructions had us review the gauge chart specifically, I did not pursue that solution.
